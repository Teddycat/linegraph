Create a search form to search the data based on two fields

Keywords - this field searches on the fields chosen in the dropdown next to it.

All - ALL fields listed below

Client

Create a line graph with your graphing library of choice. The X-axis should list the date of the order. The Y-axis should list the revenue on that particular day total. This graph should change based on search results and match the table below.

Create a table that lists all the data. The Client, Product, and Date columns should all be sortable. This table should be paginated.
